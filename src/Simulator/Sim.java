		//
		// - Make the game window
		// - render out a road/a test car (just a square)
		// - set up camera movements/locking
		// - set up primary sim variables (top speed, exit speed, cars joining per second, time, sim hz, camera start x and y positions, road dimensions and positions....)
		// - set up sim, create cars at random points
		// - set up sim "physics," handle movements of cars (or attempts at movements) crashes (cars intersecting) etc
		// - set up car AI's, we already have the beginnings of an outline.
